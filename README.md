# DictionaryScraper
A simple Perl script to retrieve and format data from the Electronic Pennsylvania Sumerian Dictionary (http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/epsd/ ).
This script must placed in and runned from your local ePSD folder. To get your off-line version of the ePSD you can use a freewebsite grabber, such as Getleft(http://personal.telefonica.terra.es/web/getleft/ ). The script produces an html file named sign_list.html, wich may later be imported in aword processor, such as Open Office Writer (freely available athttp://www.openoffice.org/product/writer.html), for further formatting.
